# XMRGUI

XMR GUI is in development and is in early alpha stages. This is a frontend wrapper for xmr-stak. Feel free to use the miner and submit any bugs in an issue, or improvements in a pull request.

Feel free to leave any and all suggestions for new features as I will be maintaining this regularly. 

Many of the features in the GUI do not function yet, please be patient and I will continue to update and add them.

* Currently, the dev donation is configurable through the GUI at a minimum of 1%.

Instructions:

1. Run setup - In Releases or at http://xmrgui.com/download
2. Enter your `Pool URL`, `XMR Address`, `Port Number`, and `Pool Password`. 
3. Click `Mine!`


**Special Notes:**

If you have issues with the program make sure to delete the folder at `/AppData/Roaming/XMRGUI` and reinstall.
Choosing the `Run on Idle` option has some minor issues. Please report them in the Issues section. Currently, the GUI will remember your pool information, however, it won't remember the option for `Run on Idle` even though it still functions.


If you click `Mine!` and don't get any text displayed in the terminal area, please double check your pool information for incorrect symbols.
Antivirus currently detects `xmr-stak.exe` as a potentially dangerous file. Until I can request that `xmr-stak` be whitelisted, you may need to allow it to run manually. This happens with almost all compiled versions of xmr-stak.
